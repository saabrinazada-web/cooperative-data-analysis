# Cooperative Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **cooperative age**, **number of members**, and **operational status (active or inactive)** using statistical methods. The analysis was conducted using administrative and monitoring data from cooperatives supervised by the **Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs of Semarang City**.

The project aims to support data-driven evaluation of cooperative sustainability.

## Research Objective
The main objective of this study is to examine whether:
- Older cooperatives tend to remain active.
- Cooperatives with more members have a higher likelihood of being operational.

This analysis provides insight into structural factors associated with cooperative performance.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- Cooperative age  
- Number of registered members  
- Activity status (active or inactive)  

These variables represent key indicators commonly used in cooperative monitoring and supervision.

## Methodology
The analysis was performed using **Jamovi** with the following steps:
- Data cleaning and verification  
- Variable classification  
- Statistical association and correlation analysis  
- Interpretation of relationships between organizational structure and activity status  

The focus is on identifying meaningful patterns rather than causal inference.

## Tools and Technologies
- Jamovi  
- Microsoft Excel  

## Project Context
This project was developed during an **internship at the Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs of Semarang City** as part of data validation, monitoring, and evaluation activities.
